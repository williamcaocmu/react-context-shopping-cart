# Section Intro

In this section we are going to learn all about the context API in React, which is a way to store global state. Instead of storing it in the App component, we store state in a context, which then we can bring into any component that needs it using the `useContext` hook instead of passing props around everywhere.

So as far as the plan for this section, I'll talk more about the context api and what it is. We're going to start to setup a project, which will be a shopping cart UI. So we'll have products and cart items in our context. We're going to use a tool called "JSON Server" to give us a mock API to work with. This is where we'll fetch our products from and we'll display that data. We'll start off by adding the state to the App.jsx file like we have been and then we'll create a context and a provider and we'll move the state there. We'll build out the UI to include the products and a header with a cart icon as well as a dropdown to show the items. We'll add the ability to remove items from the cart and state and then once it's all working in memory, we'll persist the cart items to local storage so that you can refresh the page or leave and come back and the items will still be there.
